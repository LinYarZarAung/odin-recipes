        <h1>Meatballs</h1>
        <img src="https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/meatballs-21-600x900.jpg" alt="Meatballs">
        <p>A <strong>meatball</strong> is ground meat rolled into a ball, sometimes along with other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning.
            Meatballs are cooked by frying, baking, steaming, or braising in sauce. There are many types of meatballs using different types of meats and spices.
            The term is sometimes extended to meatless versions based on vegetables or fish; the latter are also commonly known as <em>fishballs</em>.</p>
        
        <p>The ancient Roman cookbook <em>Apicius</em> included many meatball-type recipes.
            Early recipes included in some of the earliest known Persian cookbooks generally feature seasoned lamb rolled into orange-sized balls and glazed with egg yolk and sometimes saffron.
            This method was taken to the West and is referred to as gilding. Many regional variations exist, including the unusually large <em>kufte Tabrīzī</em> from Iran's northwestern region,
            with an average diameter of <em>20 centimetres (7.9 in)</em>.
            <em>Poume d'oranges</em> is a gilded meatball dish from the Middle Ages.</p>
