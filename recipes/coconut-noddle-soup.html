        <p><strong>Coconut noddle soup(ohn no khao swè, ohn no kauk swe)</strong> is a Burmese noodle dish with <em>a spiced chicken coconut broth</em>.
           This is a great curry for those who don’t like a lot of <em>heat</em>. If you like you can add the red chili powder to your taste.
           This recipe uses <em>thin egg noodles</em>, but I have seen others with <em>rice noodles</em>.</p>
