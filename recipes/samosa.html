        <p><strong>A samosa(singara)</strong> is <em>a fried South Asian pastry</em>with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas.
            It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.
            Samosas are often accompanied by <em>chutney</em>, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.
            Samosas are a popular entr√©e, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.</p>

            <li>4 tablespoons ground dried red chilies pan roasted until fragrant</li>

            <li>1 cup fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>3 limes quartered</li>
            <li>Fish sauce to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the fish sauce, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and turmeric.
                Mix in the chicken using gloved hands.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, drizzle oil over medium high heat.
                Once thoroughly heated and shimmering, add the onions.
                Cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in the paprika, then the chicken with marinade.
                Cook, stirring often, until all sides of chicken are browned, 4-5 minutes.
                Stir in the coconut milk and chicken stock.
                Stir constantly and once it begins to boil, reduce heat to medium low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk the garbanzo bean flour with 1/2 cup warm water until smooth.
                Stir into the soup and bring to a boil. Continue to simmer over medium low heat until slightly thickened, 5-10 minutes.
                If too thin, add more garbanzo bean flour mixed with water. If too thick, add a little more water.
                Season with fish sauce or soy sauce to taste. Keep over low heat until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook just until al dente, just tender.
                Drain and rinse with cold water. Drizzle a little oil and mix to keep the noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>Divide the noodles among serving bowls. Top with the chicken coconut soup.
                Garnish as desired with hard boiled eggs, red chili powder, soaked onions, cilantro, lime, and fish sauce. Serve immediately.</li>
